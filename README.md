## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Themed ecards generator (Merry Christmas, happy birthday, congratulations, etc.), simple and immediate and with image saving.

FIRST DEMO

[December 15 2017] You'll be able to customize the background image (choosing from some predefined or inserting the URL of the image), and the text placed above it (writing what you want).
A preview will be available in real time.

Estimate of the times:
- 6 hours for the code
- 2 hours for graphics

-----------------------------------------------
SECOND DEMO

[March 12th 2018] It will be possible to correctly display the page (also in 4: 3) and save the postcard locally as an image. Furthermore the code will be validated via W3C.


- [2 hours] Save the postcard
- [2 hours] Improvements to the general graphics: color change, central alignment and new buttons
- [30 min] Code cleaning, indentation and comments
- [30 min] Code correction and W3C validation

Problems:
1) Saving the postcard through an image made it necessary to use an external library and a language unknown to me, jQuery.
  I managed to make it work after a couple of hours of testing.
2) Even the graphics gave some problems because the alignment of the content depended on the screen used, after several searches and attempts with the same results, I decided to center it for 4: 3.

With this second demo I finish my project.
